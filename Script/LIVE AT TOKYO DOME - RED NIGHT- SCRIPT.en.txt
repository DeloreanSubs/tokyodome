We welcome you to BABYMETAL WORLD TOUR 2016
LEGEND - METAL RESISTANCE -\N RED NIGHT & BLACK NIGHT TOUR FINAL
AT TOKYO DOME
The FOX GOD, the God of Metal has imparted us
with a divine omen which will be revealed\N to all of you present here today
The largest-ever FINAL BATTLE marking\N the LEGEND - METAL RESISTANCE -
spanning over 2  days,\N RED NIGHT & BLACK NIGHT, spanning over two days.
In the next 2 days,\N you will be witness to the "Melodies of Metal"
from "BABYMETAL" and "METAL RESISTANCE"
However, there are limitations to the Advent of the Gods.
A melody that is played can never be played again.
Only the FOX GOD knows\N which Melodies will be heard in the 2 Days.
There will be no MC and no Encore.
No one can put a stop to anything\N once the clock starts to tick.
Allow me to convey to you\N some very important messages.
The following are strictly prohibited.\N No cameras, recorders, mobile phones to record, film,
or live stream content from the proceedings tonight.
No glow sticks, flags, or large headgear\N that may obstruct the view of others.
Absolutely no bad conduct will be tolerated.
Upon entry you would have received\N a crystal neck brace.
Foremost this will play an important role to protect your neck\N from the approaching harsh battle.
Get ready to headbang and know that\N the harder you headbang,
the Metal Spirit that you will release will generate\N the power of light which will be stored in the neck brace.
Your Metal Spirit will surely release\N a powerful light.
During battle, put on your neck brace
and The FOX GOD bids you to never take it off.
With your co-operation,\N and when a powerful light is released,
if you bed then you may be able to go home\N in possession of the crystal neck brace.
Without further delay, the greatest battle to date,\N "LEGEND - METAL RESISTANCE -" will begin.
In the summer of 2016,
the colossal living existence known as\N the "Incarnation of God" evolved into its 4th form.
Releasing crimson red flames as it pushed\N its way through uncharted paths to Tokyo
BABYMETAL pushed through the uncharted paths of\N "METAL RESISTANCE - EPISODE IV" to descent here,
at the pinnacle of the pyramid of the TRILOGY,
the Tokyo Dome where the greatest final battle in\N history will take place.
110,000 Metal Spirits from across the world
will transfor into a powerful light
as they make their way\N to EL. DO. RA. DO to create a new LEGEND.
The time has come
To transcend generations, borders, time and space
The moment for us to become THE ONE
A new LEGEND is about to begin
One, Two, Three, Four

Any of them are alike

A little different
I wonder so after all
Different! Different!
That's not acceptable
Different! Different!
You say so, but...
Different! Different!

Tick tack tick tack
My heart beats
I can't stop this feeling running wild
Tick tack tick tack
My heart beats.
I can't stop this feeling
I scream!
Hey, it's my afternoon snack
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't take it in advance of me!
All yours are also mine
I was left alone
I looked up the sky
What a sentimetal night!
I'll go, driven by this feeling
Running away from the reality
So good!
The party under the night sky
So good!
I'll go brilliant
That for now, moshing up
Moshing up!
	Taking little by little is impossible
Yeah, yeah!
It's too transcendent
It's perfect
A gal must have
A dream
Which is surely
Super-chaotic
Super!
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Say ho, ho!
Say ho, ho!
Tokyo Dome!
Tokyo Dome!
Put your Kitsune UP!
It's a fox sign, you know?
It's not a maloik sign but a fox sign
Not a sign of the horns but a fox sign, you know
I pledged to myself
By linking my little fingers
What a sentimetal night!
I'll go, driven by this feeling
Running away from the reality
So good!
The party under the night sky
So good!
	I'll go brilliant
That for now, moshing up
Moshing up!
Taking little by little is impossible
Yeah, yeah!
It's too transcendent
It's perfect
A gal must have
A dream
Which is surely
Super-chaotic
Super!
So good!
Yeah, yeah!
So good!
Yeah, yeah!
So good!
It's super-chaotic
Yeah, yeah!
So good!
Yeah, yeah!
So good!
Yeah, yeah!
So good!
A hot heartbeat
And an urgent impulse
Go so wild that I got upset
And they can't be stopped
Like! Dislike! Like!
Like! Dislike!
My mind is so full of fantasy
That I feel scared
It shows the near future
And is about to overflow
Like! Dislike! Like!
Like! Dislike!
Ah, lit by the moonlight
With the Metal wings
Turn! Turn!
From this world
Turn!
Fly up and away
While dancing
Beyond the seasons
Coming and going around
Come and go!
Flap the wings
And fly on singing!
Let the words of love
Resound beyond the night
The beat gets so strong
That I feel pain
It shakes me to burning
And it can't be untangled
Like! Dislike! Like!
Like! Dislike!
I create a bit of future vision
The hope to see it swells
And is about to burst
Like! Dislike! Like!
Like! Dislike!
Ah, if the dark night is torn
By beams of light
Swing! Swing!
Drive melancholy away!
Swing!
When I dream of dreams
And reach out my hand
The dazzling dreams
Come and go around
Come and go!
Their rhythm!
Is the syncopation of love
Draw the shape of love
On the night sky!
From this world
Fly up and away!
Swing! Swing!
To the sky!
Fly!
Turn! Turn!
From this world
Turn!
Fly up and away
While dancing!
The dazzling dreams
Come and go around
Come and go!
Their rhythm!
Is the syncopation of love
Turn! Turn!
Fly away!
Swing! Swing!
Fly away!
Draw the shape of love
On the night sky!
Let the words of love
Resound into the night sky
Let them bring Amore to outer space
Breaking through gloomy rain clouds
One keeps running for twenty-four hours
One is destined to keep running
Ripping through the blue darkness
The moonbeam sticks in a distant place
Reflecting beautifully off the night flowers
It dances in a momentary dream
The eyes of one who made a vow
Harbor the dazzling future
Turning into a blue figure enveloped with light
Now one opens one's wings
Let the words of love resound into the night sky
Let them bring Amore to outer space
Breaking through gloomy rain clouds
One keeps running for twenty-four hours
One is destined to keep running
Even if I lose sight of you
The voice of my heart keeps singing
Even if you are far away
I keep singing with the voice of my heart
Let the words of love resound into the night sky
Let them bring Amore to outer space
The blue star that shines
Brings the life into my hands
Let the words of love resound into the night sky
Let them bring Amore to outer space
Breaking through gloomy rain clouds
One keeps running for twenty-four hours
One is destined to keep running
	Let love save the Earth
Lit up by the crimson moon
A momentary dream starts again
The circle mosh of the green commuter train
Turns into Wall of Death with the bell and the death growl
To the right?  To the left?  We're stray sheep.
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die!
It's hard for us to climb the stairway to adulthood
One-step!  Two-step!  Lift up!
We swim across the stormy world by crowd surfing.
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!  Let's go!
More, more, hey!
More, more, hey!
Let's try hard!
More, more, hey!
Lift us up more higher!
Good job!
We need not get irritated!
No!
No!
Be light-hearted!
Take it easy!
Good job!
Hazy feeling brings us nothing good!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We are the number one
When being happy-go-lucky
Soon after the shop opens
it's like a mosh'sh pit
With so-so roaring and Wall of Death
Pushing!  Shoving!
It's like a crowd pushing game
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn!
In the breakdown
We do the hardcore mosh
Forty percent, fifty percent
The prices are down!
We elegantly escape
From pressing down and pulling off
Get! Get! Get! Get!
Let's go!
More, more, hey!
More, more, hey!
Let's try hard!
More, more, hey!
Give us more extras!
More! More!
I can't hear you!
More! More!
That's not enough!
More! More!
More! More!
More! More!
That's good!
More, more, hey!
More, more, hey!
Let's try hard!
More, more, hey!
More, more, hey!
Let's try hard!
More, more, hey!
More, more, hey!
Let's try hard!
More, more, hey!
Lift us up more higher!
It's transcendent!  Perfect!
We give full marks
Even to weak-kneed persons!!
Yes!
Yes!
Don't be hasty! Take it easy!
It's perfect!
Aiming too high brings us nothing good!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We are the number one
When being happy-go-lucky
The waning moon has lit up
The insanity rampant in the shade
The laughter resounds around
It bares its fangs and its eyes gleam
I can't escape from it
It flickers slowly
Appearing and disappearing in my mind
A nightmare rondo is being repeated
The awakening light
Is gone far away out of my sight
I can do nothing but run
Through the darkness
In the woods
In the fountain
I hide myself holding my breath
But it's still coming closer to me
A stagnant voice
An endless night
Ah...
If I can no longer get out of here
Won't you show me your figure?
It flickers slowly
Appearing and disappearing in my mind
A nightmare rondo is being repeated
The awakening light
Is gone far away out of my sight
I can do nothing but fall
Into the darkness
YUIMETAL and MOAMETAL\N are pulled into the Dark Side
by DEATH VADER
The time for begging for this\N and that has ended.
By the supreme power of the "4" th
the two are finally awaken.
An awakening provoked\N by the Dark Side and the Light Side
Our meeting was not a coincidence.\N Nothing happens by accident.
Good-bye, father.\N We will never ask you for a favor again.
May the 4th be with you.
This is the start of a new Story

The old powerful light and the one
Sailed toward EL. DO. RA. DO
aboard the Metal Ark\N in an attempt to trigger the final countdown.
Let the preparation begin.
To all of you here.\N Do you have your neck-brace on?
Without your neck-brace \Nyou will lose your light and passage
aboard the Metal Ark destined\N to EL. DO. RA. DO
No matter how treacherous\N this journey might be for The One
No one can stop our Tales.
No matter what your destiny may be
Fifty five seconds and counting
Neil Armstrong just reported back\N It's been a real smooth countdown.
We've passed the fifty second mark.
Power transfer is complete
We're on internal power\N with the launch vehicle at this time.
Five, four, three, two, one
We have no luck!  We are unlucky!
Our answer is always...
We can't help it!  It can't be helped!
Not! Not! Not! Not!
Not!
That is not it!  This is not it!
Where is the answer?
Nowhere!  Nowhere!  Nowhere!  Nowhere!
Nowhere,  nowhere,  nowhere, nowhere, Nowhere!
Nowhere, Nowhere!
Don't worry, don't worry!
Now we're going to reborn
Let's begin the countdown!
Set me free!
Three, two, one, three, two, one, zero?
Three, two, one, three, two, one, zero?
It never stops
It never ends
it never stops!
It never ends!
It's an unlimited melody
Melody!
We never
We never!
We never look back
Now and Forever
It is our eternal memory
THE ONE will be with you
We are The Destinies
Isn't it useless?  It's not useless!
No, no, no, no!
Isn't it impossible?  It's not impossible!
Isn't it a dream?  It's not a dream!

Let's aim at the big chance!
Get ready!

Please take us to the land of dreams
Yeah!
We are THE ONE!
Together!
We are the only one
You are THE ONE!
Forever!
You are the only one
We are THE ONE!
Together!
We are the only one
You are THE ONE!
Forever!
You're the only one
I feel it now
The time has come for us
Believe it now
It's time to get ready
Tell me why!
You know that this is the end of the world
Tell me why
You know it's the truth
We stand in a circle pit
Side by side
Hand in hand
We stand in a circle pit
Raise your hands
Aa!
This is our song
One for All!
This is our dream
All for One!
Please take us to the land of dreams
Faraway!
We are THE ONE!
Together!
We are the only one
You are THE ONE!
Forever!
You are the only one
We are THE ONE!
Whenever!
We are on your side
You are THE ONE!
Remember!
Always on your side
We are THE ONE!
Together!
We are the only one
You are THE ONE!
Forever!
Ah ah ah ah ah!
Sing it!
Forever\N We'll be here
