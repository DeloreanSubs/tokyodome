Going over thousands nights
Some love shall survive
So, until my body perishes
Until my life disappears
I shall keep on cherishing this love
I'ts the dawn!
Shining in the depths of the eyes
the moon is about to cry
Red tears overflow
And dye the night sky
In the silence
The two damaged blades stand face to face
Our loneliness and our uneasiness
Slash even our hearts
Going over thousands nights
Some love shall survive
So, until my body perishes
Until my life disappears
I shall keep on cherishing this love
In the passage of time
I keep my eyes shut
Even if the red thread flowing in my hand breaks
I still feel we are tied
In the silence
I hold the damaged blade face to face
My loneliness and my uneasiness
I slash, even my heart
Now!
Going over thousands nights
Some love shall survive
So, until my body perishes
Until my life disappears someday
Going over thousands nights
Some love shall survive
So, until my body perishes
Until my life disappears
I shall keep on cherishing this love

Why can't I sleep?
Why does the night end?
I don't want anything, even tomorrow
The future without you
Why was I smiling?
Why so though I was feeling lonely?
Nobody knows that I really just
Wanted you to be by my side
Even the despair becomes the light
Though an endless rain continues to fall
Even the despair becomes the light
A sad rain throws a rainbow
Far far away
We shall never meet again
But I want not to forget you forever
If the dream continues, I wish I'll never wake up from it
Why was I smiling?
Why so though I was feeling lonely?
Nobody knows that I really just
wanted to see you That was all
Even the despair becomes the light
Though an endless rain continues to fall
Even the despair becomes the light
A sad rain throws a rainbow
Even now!
An endless rain fills my heart
Forever!

On the left side

Standing up still, leaning back
Jumping toward the stage
And then!
Leaning over the fence
